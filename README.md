# Bubble?

> An [economic bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble) (also called a speculative bubble or a financial bubble) is a period when current asset prices greatly exceed their intrinsic valuation, being the valuation that the underlying long-term fundamentals justify. Bubbles can be caused by overly optimistic projections about the scale and sustainability of growth (e.g. dot-com bubble), and/or by the belief that intrinsic valuation is no longer relevant when making an investment (e.g. Tulip mania).

Generative AI is in an economic bubble? Some people, including me, think so. But nothing makes sense anymore...

# Why so negative?

I think there's already enough (and probably too much) coverage on the pros of (Generative) AI and I think it's important to get both sides of the story.
